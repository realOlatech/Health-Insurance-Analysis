# Health Insurance Coverage & Penetration Gap Analysis

### Project Overview
---
This project analyzes health insurance data across multiple neighborhoods and age groups to evaluate insurance penetration, coverage rates, and uninsured exposure. The objective is to identify demographic segments with enrollment gaps and quantify the disparity between insurance availability and actual participation.

### Business Problem

Although insurance coverage infrastructure exists, actual enrollment remains uneven across age groups. The analysis investigates:

- Which demographic groups have the highest uninsured exposure?
- Does higher coverage correlate with higher penetration?
- Where are the largest enrollment gaps?

### Data Preparation & Transformation

- Cleaned raw insurance dataset
- Aggregated data using Pivot Tables
- Calculated:
  - Average Coverage Rate
  - Average Insurance Penetration Rate
  - Average Uninsured Rate
- Segmented results by:
  - Age Group
  - Neighborhood

### Analytical Approach

- Comparative analysis by age group
- Gap analysis between coverage and penetration
- Correlation visualization (scatter plot)
- KPI development for executive-level reporting

### Key Findings

- A significant gap exists between coverage availability (89%) and insurance penetration (45%).
- The Under 18 population has the highest uninsured exposure.
- The 35–64 segment demonstrates the strongest enrollment performance.

### Business Recommendations

- Target Under 18 population with subsidized insurance programs.
- Improve digital enrollment for 18–34 segment.
- Enhance assisted enrollment programs for 65+ group.

### Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel
   - Pivot Tables
   - Slicers
   - KPI Cards
   - Data Visualization
   - Dashboard Design

### 𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬 𝐟𝐨𝐜𝐮𝐬𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐧 𝐟𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬:

- Under 18
- 18–34
- 35–64
- 65+

### 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐝𝐚𝐬𝐡𝐛𝐨𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐚𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐬:

- Average Coverage Rate: 89%
- Average Insurance Penetration Rate: 45%
- Average Uninsured Rate: 55%

#### Key Observation:

Although coverage availability is high (89%), actual insurance penetration is significantly lower (45%). This indicates a gap between availability and enrollment, suggesting that accessibility alone does not guarantee participation.

### Age Group Analysis

- Under 18
  - Penetration Rate: 34%
  - Uninsured Rate: 66%

This group has the lowest insurance penetration and the highest rate of uninsured individuals. This may indicate limited parental enrollment, affordability challenges, or low awareness of child-focused insurance programs.

- 18–34
   - Penetration Rate: 58%
   - Coverage Rate: 83%
   - Uninsured Rate: 42%

Young adults show moderate penetration levels. However, a substantial portion remains uninsured. Possible reasons include informal employment, lower perceived health risk, and cost sensitivity.

- 35–64
   - Penetration Rate: 60% (Highest)
   - Coverage Rate: 86%
   - Uninsured Rate: 40%

This age group demonstrates the strongest insurance participation. Stable employment and increased health awareness are likely contributing factors to higher enrollment rates.

- 65+
   - Penetration Rate: 29%
   - Coverage Rate: 99% (Highest)

Although coverage is nearly universal, penetration remains low. This suggests that eligibility or coverage structures exist, but private enrollment may be limited. Public health programs may play a significant role in this age group.

### Comparative Insights

- Higher coverage does not automatically translate into higher penetration.
- The largest insurance gap exists among Under 18 and 65+ populations.
- The 35–64 group represents the most stable and insured demographic.

More than half of the overall population remains uninsured (55%), highlighting a significant policy and market opportunity.

### Recommendations

- Target Under 18 Population
   - Promote family insurance packages
   - Increase awareness through schools and community programs
   - Provide subsidized child coverage options

- Improve Young Adult Enrollment
   - Introduce flexible and affordable plans
   - Leverage digital enrollment platforms

- Enhance Senior Enrollment Support
  - Simplify registration processes
  - Provide assisted enrollment services
 
### Conclusion
---
The analysis highlights a critical gap between insurance coverage availability and actual enrollment. While coverage rates are high across age groups, penetration remains moderate, and uninsured levels are significant.
Strategic interventions targeting vulnerable and under-enrolled groups particularly Under 18 and 65+ populations could substantially improve overall insurance participation and reduce uninsured rates.
