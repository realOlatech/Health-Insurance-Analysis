# Health Insurance Coverage & Penetration Gap Analysis

### Project Overview

This project analyzes health insurance data across multiple neighborhoods and age groups to evaluate insurance penetration, coverage rates, and uninsured exposure. The objective is to identify demographic segments with enrollment gaps and quantify the disparity between insurance availability and actual participation.

### Business Problem

Although insurance coverage infrastructure exists, actual enrollment remains uneven across age groups. The analysis investigates:

- Which demographic groups have the highest uninsured exposure?
- Does higher coverage correlate with higher penetration?
- Where are the largest enrollment gaps?

### Data Preparation & Transformation

- Cleaned raw insurance dataset
- Aggregated data using Pivot Tables
- Calculated:
  - Average Coverage Rate
  - Average Insurance Penetration Rate
  - Average Uninsured Rate
- Segmented results by:
  - Age Group
  - Neighborhood

### Analytical Approach

- Comparative analysis by age group
- Gap analysis between coverage and penetration
- Correlation visualization (scatter plot)
- KPI development for executive-level reporting

### Key Findings

- A significant gap exists between coverage availability (89%) and insurance penetration (45%).
- The Under 18 population has the highest uninsured exposure.
- The 35–64 segment demonstrates the strongest enrollment performance.

### Business Recommendations

- Target Under 18 population with subsidized insurance programs.
- Improve digital enrollment for 18–34 segment.
- Enhance assisted enrollment programs for 65+ group.

### Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel
   - Pivot Tables
   - Slicers
   - KPI Cards
   - Data Visualization
   - Dashboard Design
